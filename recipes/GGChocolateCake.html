    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> 
        <em>From the webiste:</em> This is my great-grandmother's recipe that she passed down to me, 
        and it is quite simply the best chocolate dessert I have ever had. 
        It's so simple and so yummy! Beware--if you bring this to a party it will go fast!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>

        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

        <li>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Combine remaining 1/2 cup butter, 3 tablespoons cocoa powder, and milk in a small saucepan; stir over medium heat until butter is melted and mixture is well combined.
